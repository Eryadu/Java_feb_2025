## In Java 8, method references provide a concise way to refer to methods or constructors without invoking them. 
They are a shorthand for lambda expressions that simply call a method.

Note : Used mostly for Utility method as they used everywhere, and not gonna change typically

Syntax
ClassName::methodName
Or for instance methods:

object::methodName

## Types of Method References
1. Static Method Reference
(args) -> ClassName.staticMethod(args)
ClassName::staticMethod
Example:

List<String> list = Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c");
list.forEach(System.out::println);  // Calls System.out.println(s)

2. Instance Method Reference of a Particular Object
(args) -> instance.method(args)
instance::method
Example:

Consumer<String> printer = System.out::println;
printer.accept("Hello");  // Prints: Hello

3. Instance Method Reference of an Arbitrary Object of a Particular Type (Class)
-- You use ClassName::instanceMethod when the instance is passed implicitly (e.g., through a stream or lambda).
-- Java understands that the method will be called on each object passed in.
check example : we create object and passed as Argument
(arg1, arg2) -> arg1.instanceMethod(arg2)
ClassName::instanceMethod
Example:

List<String> list = Arrays.asList("b", "a", "c");
list.sort(String::compareTo);  // Calls a.compareTo(b)

4. Constructor Reference
() -> new ClassName()
ClassName::new
Example:

Supplier<List<String>> listSupplier = ArrayList::new;
List<String> list = listSupplier.get();

## Why Use Method References?
-- Cleaner and more readable code.
-- Avoids boilerplate code in lambda expressions.


## what is the major difference between lambda and method reference?

The major difference between a lambda expression and a method reference in Java 8 is mainly syntactic clarity and 
intentionality, not functionality. Both are used to pass behavior (i.e., functions) as arguments, but they
differ in how that behavior is expressed.

ðŸ”‘ Key Differences
Feature	        Lambda Expression	                        Method Reference
Syntax	        Explicit and flexible	                    Concise shorthand
Readability	S   lightly more verbose	                    More readable when only calling a method
Use Case	    Good for inline logic or custom behavior	Best when reusing existing methods
Structure	    args -> method(args)	                    ClassName::methodName

âœ… Example
Lambda:
list.forEach(s -> System.out.println(s));

Method Reference (shorthand):
list.forEach(System.out::println);

Both are functionally the same, but:

-- Use lambdas when you want to write custom behavior inline.
-- Use method references when you're simply delegating to an existing method â€” itâ€™s cleaner and easier to read.

ðŸ§  Think of it this way:
Lambdas: You describe what to do.
Method references: You say which existing method should be used.


ðŸ§¾ Method Reference vs Lambda Cheat Sheet
Use Case	                                              Method Reference	            Lambda Equivalent
1. Static method	                                    ClassName::staticMethod	        (args) -> ClassName.staticMethod(args)
2. Instance method of a specific object	                instance::instanceMethod	    (args) -> instance.instanceMethod(args)
3. Instance method of an arbitrary object (from class)	ClassName::instanceMethod	    (obj, args) -> obj.instanceMethod(args)
4. Constructor (no args)	                            ClassName::new	                () -> new ClassName()
5. Constructor (with args)	                            ClassName::new	                (args) -> new ClassName(args)
