## Set
-- Cannot be duplicate /unique elements
-- does not have order (random order)
-- only one null is allowed

marker interface ??
without anything inside

Serialization ?? Read
Serialization is part of marker interface

## Set is Data Structure (Interface), who's implementation is with HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedSet

##          Set
|           |           |
Hashset   TreeSet   Linked hashset

Hashset is implementation of Set


Explore Set ??

## Difference between Hashset, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet

## HashSet
: Random Order

## TreeSet
: Natural Sorting order
: no null is allowed

## LinkedHashset
: Order is maintained
insertion order

// HashSet  --- Hashmap ---- LinkedList of Arraylist

These are Utilities classes.
## Arrays ?? class explore
## Collections explore ??


## Iterator
## ListIterator

/*
ForLoops
Iterator
Create ListIterator
Use iterator for HashSet


        Smallest and largest number in arraylist
        Numbers greater than 10 and less than 10
