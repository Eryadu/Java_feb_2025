What is a cloud ?

for storage, other than local
no need to purchase physical hardware, or setup
outsourcing the hardware need


refers to the on demand availability of compute resources
like storage, networking, software

Infrastructure - compute, networking, software

## Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of 
buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as 
computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Pros:
no need to maintain the hardware
pay per use

Scaling -- Horizontal scaling / vertical scaling
Redundancy -- multiple copies at different location by backup the data, help to save data

## Latency: how fast data is accessible when anyone try to accessing it. Latency measures in nanoseconds

Cons:

Security
Internet
Downtime

## Types of cloud
           Services  provider (IaaS)
AWS        EC2 
Azure      Azure VM
GCP        Google computing Engine

Digital ocean
IBM cloud
Alibaba cloud
Akamai 

## EC2

## lambda Server

AWS Lambda - serverless server - means you don't care about server(don't need to manage), you can run yous code
compute service where you don't have to manage the server
