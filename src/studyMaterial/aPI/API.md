## API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allow different software
   applications to communicate with each other. APIs define how software components should interact, making it easier for 
   developers to integrate and use functionalities from other systems or services.

## API is set of two system

## Key Concepts of APIs:

1. Interface: An API acts as an interface between two systems, allowing them to exchange data and functionality.
2. Endpoints: APIs expose specific endpoints (URLs) that can be accessed to perform certain actions or retrieve data.
3. Requests and Responses: APIs typically work on a request-response model. A client sends a request to the API, and the 
   server sends back a response.

## Methods: APIs use standard HTTP methods like:
-- GET: Retrieve data.
-- POST: Send data to create or update resources.
-- PUT: Update existing resources.
-- DELETE: Remove resources.
-- Data Formats: APIs often use data formats like JSON or XML to structure the data being sent or received.

## Types of APIs:

-- Web APIs: Used for web-based systems (e.g., REST, SOAP, GraphQL).
-- Library APIs: Provided by software libraries or frameworks (e.g., Python's requests library).
-- Operating System APIs: Allow applications to interact with the OS (e.g., Windows API, POSIX).
-- Hardware APIs: Enable software to interact with hardware devices (e.g., printer APIs).

-- Common Use Cases:
- Integrating third-party services (e.g., payment gateways, social media platforms).
- Building microservices architectures.
- Enabling mobile apps to communicate with servers.
- Automating workflows between systems.

Example:
A weather service might provide an API that allows developers to retrieve weather data by sending a request to an endpoint like:
GET https://api.weather.com/v1/forecast?location=NewYork

The response might look like this in JSON:
{
"location": "New York",
"temperature": "22Â°C",
"conditions": "Sunny"
}
