## Wrapper classes

Autoboxing --> automatic conversion between primitive types to objects
Unboxing --> Object type to primitive

-- > Collection don't work with primitive data types that's why use wrapper class.

## Immutable class
Can't modify

-- all the field should be final and private
-- class should be final
-- class should be no setter method
-- we should override equals and hashcode method

## equal() and hashcode()
if two objects are equal they must have the same hashcode

Object 1  -- xtv12sd
Object 2  -- xtv12sd

## Collections

Data Structure : how we structure our data for efficient access or storage of data

Its framework for modifying/mainupulating objects
It has set of interfaces and classes which are already defined for us

## Type safety ??
## generics introduced to have type safety in Java collection

Generic --> General form of something, not specific
Advantage of generic
1. type safety
2. flexibility of choosing a collection type/ object type
