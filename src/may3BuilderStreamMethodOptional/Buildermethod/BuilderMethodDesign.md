## Method Chaining: In java, Method Chaining is used to invoke multiple methods on the same object which occurs as a 
single statement. Method-chaining is implemented by a series of methods that return the this reference for a class instance.

## Implementation: As return values of methods in a chain is this reference, this implementation allows us to invoke 
methods in chain by having the next method invocation on the return value of the previous method in the chain.
