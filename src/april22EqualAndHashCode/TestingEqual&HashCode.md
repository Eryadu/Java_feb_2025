1. Question:
What happens if you override hashCode() but not equals() in a Java class, and then use it as a key in a HashMap with put()?

-- If you override hashCode() but not equals(), you break the general contract between the two, and HashMap behavior
   becomes inconsistent.

Specifically:
-- put() will store the value using your custom hash.
-- But get() or containsKey() may not find it, because equals() still uses default Object.equals() (which compares references).

## Why?
HashMap Lookup Logic:
-- It calls .hashCode() to find the bucket.
-- Then it uses .equals() to find the exact key in that bucket.
-- If you override hashCode() but not equals(), two logically "equal" objects may:
-- End up in the same bucket, but
-- Fail equality check, because the default equals() checks reference equality.

## Conclusion:
-- If you override hashCode(), you MUST also override equals(), and they must agree:
-- If a.equals(b) is true, then a.hashCode() == b.hashCode() must also be true.

2. if we override equal() and don't hashcode() method then how put() will behave

🔥 TL;DR:
If you override equals() but not hashCode(), your HashMap keys can become broken, leading to:
Keys that are "equal" according to equals(), but
Land in different buckets because their hashCode() values differ (default Object.hashCode() is identity-based).

This results in:
-- put() storing multiple "equal" keys
-- get() or containsKey() potentially returning null even when an "equal" key exists

⚠️ Why this happens:
p1.equals(p2) is true
But p1.hashCode() != p2.hashCode() because both still use Object.hashCode() (which is based on memory address)
So HashMap puts them in different buckets, and can't find the key when using p2.

✅ Best Practice:
If you override equals(), you must also override hashCode() so that equal objects have the same hash code.

# how put and get method behave when  override the equal() method only ?

🔧 Scenario: Only equals() is overridden (not hashCode())
You're using a class as a key in a HashMap, and you override equals() but not hashCode().

✅ put() Behavior
When you use put(key, value):

The HashMap computes the hash code of the key using hashCode().

It looks in the bucket corresponding to that hash code.

If there are other entries in that bucket, it uses equals() to see if the key already exists.

If a match is found (according to equals()), the value is replaced.

But if hashCode() isn’t overridden properly, your key might end up in a completely different bucket—even if it’s 
logically "equal" to an existing key.

👉 So, the map might store duplicates even though equals() says they're the same!

❌ get() Behavior
When you call get(key):

It again uses hashCode() to find the right bucket.

Then it uses equals() to compare keys inside that bucket.

If your hashCode() doesn't match the one used in put(), then it will look in the wrong bucket, and get() will return 
null — even though a logically equal key is in the map.

🧪 Example:

Edit
class MyKey {
int id;

    MyKey(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (obj instanceof MyKey) {
            return this.id == ((MyKey) obj).id;
        }
        return false;
    }
    // No hashCode() override!
}

Map<MyKey, String> map = new HashMap<>();

MyKey key1 = new MyKey(1);
MyKey key2 = new MyKey(1); // equals() will say key1 == key2

map.put(key1, "Hello");
System.out.println(map.get(key2)); // ❌ returns null, not "Hello"
🧠 Summary
If you override equals() but not hashCode(), you break the general contract of hashCode(), which can lead to:

Duplicate keys (as far as equals() is concerned)

get() returning null for keys that should match

✅ Best Practice
Always override both equals() and hashCode() when using objects as keys in hash-based collections like HashMap or HashSet.


* how put and get method behave when  override the hashcode() method only ?
  🔧 Scenario: Only hashCode() is overridden (not equals())
  Your key class has a custom hashCode(), but uses the default equals() method (i.e., inherited from Object, 
* which compares by reference).

✅ put() Behavior
When you do map.put(key, value):

HashMap uses your custom hashCode() to find the correct bucket.

Then, it uses equals() to check if the key already exists within that bucket.

Since you didn’t override equals(), it checks if the object references are the same (i.e., key1 == key2).

So if you create two different instances that have the same hashCode(), they will still be treated as different keys 
because equals() returns false.

👉 Result: Duplicates (logically equal, but different references) can be inserted.

❌ get() Behavior
When you do map.get(someKey):

The map uses your hashCode() to find the correct bucket.

Then it compares each key in the bucket using equals().

But since you didn’t override equals(), only the exact same instance (same memory address) will match.

👉 If you use a new object with the same data (and hashCode), it still won't retrieve the value — get() will return null.

🧪 Example:

class MyKey {
int id;

    MyKey(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return id * 31; // Custom hash code
    }
    // No equals() override!
}

Map<MyKey, String> map = new HashMap<>();

MyKey key1 = new MyKey(1);
MyKey key2 = new MyKey(1); // same data, same hashCode, but different instances, so store at different indexes

map.put(key1, "Hello");
System.out.println(map.get(key2)); // ❌ returns null
Even though key1.hashCode() == key2.hashCode(), key1.equals(key2) is false — because equals() is not overridden.

🧠 Summary
If you override only hashCode() and not equals():

put() may store multiple "equal" keys as separate entries

get() will fail unless you pass the exact same object instance

✅ Best Practice (Again)
Always override both equals() and hashCode() when using a class as a key in HashMap or similar structures. 
They work together!


* how put and get method behave when do not override the equal() and hashcode() method only ?

🔧 Scenario: Do NOT override equals() or hashCode()
In this case, your class uses the default implementations from java.lang.Object:

equals() compares object references (i.e., ==)

hashCode() returns a number based on the object's memory address (not data)

✅ put() Behavior
When you call map.put(key, value):

The default hashCode() is used → based on object identity

That determines the bucket

Then equals() is used to see if the key already exists — and since it checks only reference equality (==), it will 
consider only the exact same object as equal.

👉 So every new object — even if it has the same field values — will be treated as a completely different key.

❌ get() Behavior
When you call map.get(key):

Uses default hashCode() to find the bucket

Uses default equals() (i.e., reference equality) to find the key in that bucket

So unless you pass the exact same object you used in put(), get() will return null.

🧪 Example:

class MyKey {
int id;

    MyKey(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    // No equals() or hashCode() override
}

Map<MyKey, String> map = new HashMap<>();

MyKey key1 = new MyKey(1);
MyKey key2 = new MyKey(1); // same data, but different object

map.put(key1, "Hello");
System.out.println(map.get(key2)); // ❌ returns null
🧠 Summary
If you don’t override equals() or hashCode(), then:

HashMap will treat each new instance as a unique key, even if the fields are the same

put() will always insert a new key-value pair

get() will only work with the exact same object reference used in put()

✅ Rule of Thumb
If you're using your custom class as a key in any hash-based collection:

Always override both equals() and hashCode() so that logical equality (based on content) works as expected.
